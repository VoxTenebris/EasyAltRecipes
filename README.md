# Easy Alternative Recipes
_Keep it simple, ~~stupid~~ silly!_

---

**Beta Warning:** The recipe ratios may change based on feedback. Always read the changelogs!

This is an open-source mod that aims to simplify the alternate recipes and boost their efficiency. It can be described as a cheat mod by some, but perhaps it's a time-saver for others.

The mod adds 40 recipes, and to use it, a new research tree will be available in MAM, in which you must unlock its nodes. There's no requirement to have the original recipes.

If you find a bug or have an idea for new recipes, please contact me through [Satisfactory Modding](https://discord.gg/satisfactorymodding) Discord server (**VoxTenebris#9999**) or raise an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/VoxTenebris/EasyAltRecipes/issues "GitHub Issue Page").
