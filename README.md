# Easy Alternative Recipes
Keep it simple, ~~stupid~~ silly!

**Beta Warning:** The recipe ratios may change based on feedback. Always read the changelogs!

This mod can be described as mild cheaty for some, but a time-saver for others. As you might have guessed from the title, the goal is simplify the alternative recipe ratios.
To start using the new recipes, you must complete the milestones through your HUB. There's no need to unlock the original recipes.

**Current modified recipes:**

 * Copper Alloy Ingot (T3): Copper Ore (60/m) + Iron Ore (60/m) = Copper Ingot (120/m)
 * Encased Industrial Pipe (T4): Steel Pipe (30/m) + Concrete (20/m) = E.I.B. (5/m)
 * Quickwire Stator (T4): Steel Pipe (30/m) + Quickwire (120/m) = Stator (15/m)
 * Pure Iron Ingot (T5): Iron Ore (30/m) + Water (30/m) = Iron Ingot (60/m)
 * Pure Copper Ingot (T5): Copper Ore (30/m) + Water (30/m) = Copper Ingot (60/m)
 * Recycled Plastic (T5): Rubber (25/m) + Fuel (25/m) = Plastic (50/m)
 * Recycled Rubber (T5): Plastic (25/m) + Fuel (25/m) = Rubber (50/m)
