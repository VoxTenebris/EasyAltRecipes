# Easy Alternative Recipes
_Keep it simple, ~~stupid~~ silly!_

**Beta Warning:** The recipe ratios may change based on feedback. Always read the changelogs!

This mod can be described as cheat by some, but perhaps a time-saver for others, the aim is to simplify the alternative recipe ratios without deviating too much.

To start using the new recipes, you must complete the milestones through your HUB. There's no need to unlock the original recipes.
